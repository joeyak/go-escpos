[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) is just us keeping track of what commands have and haven't been done.

There are two pdfs we found with specs on how to communicate with ESC/POS printers.

[POS-80-Series_Programmer_Manual.pdf](./POS-80-Series_Programmer_Manual.pdf) is the hoin programmer manual

[Commande ESCPOS.pdf](./Commande%20ESCPOS.pdf) is the aures programmer manual

Also epson seems to have a [list of commands](https://download4.epson.biz/sec_pubs/pos/reference_en/escpos/commands.html) on their site.
